## Another "great" experience when checking new version of NextJS

- Fast refresh is unstable(still)
- Turbopack unstable
- Cannot resolve bcrypt or fs modules
- Invoices chapter is completely broken (you can't bind id to invoice)
- Installed packages could opt-out even reopening editor not help at all (only reinstall)
- Optimizing Images is broken but next team claims everything is fine
  ImageError: Unable to optimize image and unable to fallback to upstream image
  at imageOptimizer (C:\Users\Desktop\Coding\Projects\Web\next-14-check\node_modules\next\dist\server\image-optimizer.js:659:19)

- A lot of React Canary features represented as stable (RSC)
- App router is still a huge mess, vision that bring too much cost for the servers
- Better still use as frontend shell

### TLDR This was the most frustrating experience with NextJS

    - Sometimes I feel devs at Vercel rushing too fast, it seems like 2.3+ issues are not enough already, let's     bring more instability
    - Could not even finish the course, link below, because how ridiculously this unstable was

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
